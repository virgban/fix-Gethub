# fix-Gethub
Make notes and suggestion on how GetHub works or does not work.

3/24/2021 : Followed instructins to create a repository. 
Followed instructions Tip: 
Open this guide in a separate browser window (or tab) so you can see it while you complete the steps in the tutorial.
So GetHub wants you to be able to do stuff while being able to read the instructions. Good idea.
Unfortunately, they fail to mention that to actualy create a repository, you have to enter the URL
"https://github.com/" simce https://guides.github.com does not show the " sign in the upper right
